# Abertay Analytics
Abertay Analytics is a Unity package developed by Gareth Robinson at Abertay University in Dundee.
It is a simplified interface to allow for analytic data gathering in the Unity game engine.
The package provides a unified interface that can send data to a local .csv file or, if set-up, Unity Analytics.

# Installing Abertay Analytics
The simplest way to install the Abertay Analytics package in your Unity project is to click the green `Code` dropdown above and copy the [Web URL](https://github.com/Abertay-University-SDI/AbertayAnalytics.git).
Then, in your Unity project, open the Package Manager window (Window->Package Manager).
In this window there is a '+' dropdown in the top left of the screen that reveals an option to add a new package from a git URL. Paste the link to the repository into this.

If this does *not* work, an alternative method is to instead click the green dropdown above and download a .zip file of the project.
From here, you should be able extract the .zip and copy the "AbertayAnalytics-main" folder into the "Packages" folder of your Unity project.
